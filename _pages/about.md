Mostly interested in computational approaches to understand host-pathogen interactions. As I studied a bachelors in Genomic Sciences I soon got into bioinformatics and computational biology. After the university, I worked on antibody repertoirs to compare immunologic challenges. In 2013 I started a masters at the University of Basel and performed my thesis at the National University of Singapore working with lipidomics data from clinical isolated of malaria patientes. Currently, I am on my last year of my PhD working on Short Linear Motifs at the host-pathogen interface.
