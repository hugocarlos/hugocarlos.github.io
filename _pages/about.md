Mostly interested in computational approaches to understand host-pathogen interactions. Trained in Genomic Sciences I quickly became interested in bioinformatics and computational biology. After university, I worked on antibody repertoires to compare immunologic challenges. In 2013,  I pursued a master's degree at the University of Basel, conducting my thesis research at the National University of Singapore where I worked with lipidomics data from clinical isolates of malaria patients. I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Heidelberg, where my research focused on Short Linear Motifs at the host-pathogen interface at EMBL. Currently, I work as Assistant Professor at the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) and as lecturer for the Bioinformatics courses of the Biomedical Informatics bachelor's programme at ZJE, in China.
