Mostly interested in computational approaches to understand host-pathogen interactions. As I studied a bachelors in Genomic Sciences I soon got into bioinformatics and computational biology. After the university, I worked on antibody repertoires to compare immunologic challenges. In 2013 I started a masters at the University of Basel and performed my thesis at the National University of Singapore working with lipidomics data from clinical isolates of malaria patients. I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Heidelberg, after working with Short Linear Motifs at the host-pathogen interface at EMBL Heidelberg. Currently, I work as a lecturer at the Biomedical Informatics and Biomedical Sciences Bachelor Programmes as well as in the Dual Degree PhD programme on Integrative Biomedical Sciences at the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute in China.
